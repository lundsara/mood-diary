# Project-3

## App proposal #

We will create an app that will allow people to write reviews based on how they feel attended social events. We will use IBM watson API to parse through what the user inputted which will give back data on the emotional feelings through sentiment awareness AI. The feelings range from: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness.

## Technologies used # 

* HTML5/CSS3
* React.js
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Google Firebase
* IBM Tone Analyzer API

## MVP #

* Create server
* Create DB
* Create google auth login
* CRUD 

## Post-MVP #

* Use a second API

## User story #

* When the user starts the app, they will either login to an existing account or create a brand new account
* Once the user signs in, they will be able to either check out other people reviews about different events that they had attended or the user can write a review of their own about an event they had attended
* Thanks to IBM watson API, it will dispaly five different types of feelings: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness. IMB watson will grade the user on each category based on how they are feeling.
